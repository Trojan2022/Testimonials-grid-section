      Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
      learning from their experiences was easy.
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of 
      code. I needed some structure from professionals who can 
      help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
      enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
